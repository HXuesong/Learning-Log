# 每日口语
- 场景1：不舍😟
We love having you here, and there is room, and ...
and when the baby comes, the baby can stay in your room for a while.
我们喜欢你们住在这儿，这里有地方，而且...
到孩子生下来的时候，可以先让他谁在你们房间一段时间。
Richard feels we need to find a small house.
Richard觉得我们需要一所小房子。
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.
Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa.
Philip was a young doctor, and he kept talking about having a house of our own. 
**It's natural.**
我记得我怀Richard的时候，Philip和我跟你爷爷奶奶住在一起。
Philip当时是个年轻的大夫，他老是说要有自己的家。**这是很自然的事**。



- 场景2：历史重演🏠
When did you buy a house?
那你们在什么时候买房子呢？
After Richard was born. 
I was teaching music, and Philip was opening his first medical office.
等生下Richard之后。我当时教音乐，而Philip则第一次开诊所。
Where was the house?    房子在什么地方？
Right here in Riverdale. Of course, it was a small house, but just right for us.
就在这里，Riverdale。当然，那是一栋小房子，但正好够我们住。
It's funny. **History repeats itself.** 
Now Richard and I are having a baby, 
and we probably won't be able to afford a house right away, either.
真有意思。**历史在重演**。
现在，Richard和我有了孩子，而我们也许也一样不能马上负担得起一栋房子。



- 场景3：热心♥
Maybe we should speak to a real-estate agent about a house.
也许我们应该和房地产仲介商谈一谈关于房子的事。
And a bank about a mortgage.
还要和银行谈谈贷款。
I'll talk to Richard about it. I think it's a good jdea, Ellen. We can learn a lot by asking.
我会与Richard商量商量。我觉得这是个好主意，Ellen。 我们到处问问会学到不少东西。
And **if I can be of any help, let me know**.
**如果我能有所帮忙的话，告诉我**。



- 场景4：母胎学霸👼
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?
爷爷，爸爸是什么时候从Michigan毕业的？
Let me think. 
He graduated from medical school in 1960 and from the University of Michigan in 1956.
让我想想。他是1960年从医学院毕业的，从Michigan大学毕业是1956年。
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?
爷爷，你上的也是Michigan大学吗？
**Yup**. I graduated in 1937.
对，我是1937年毕业的。
I've got to start thinking about college soon.
我很快也得开始考虑大学的事了。



- 场景5：成绩不唯一💯
Did you bring your transcript from high school?
你把高中的成绩单带来了吗？
Yes, sir. **Right here**.    带来了，先生，在这里。
Thank you. Please sit down. I see under “activities" 
that you've been writing for the school paper.
谢谢，请坐。我看到在“活动”一项中提到你给校刊写稿子。
Yes, sir.    是的，先生。
What kinds of articles have you written?
你都写了哪方面的稿子？
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews. **You name it**, I've written it.
各种各样的一体育、社论、剧评。**你说得出的**，我都写过。
